Understanding kiln's core concepts helps you make the most of its security features and team collaboration capabilities.

## Age Encryption

kiln uses [age encryption](https://age-encryption.org/) as its cryptographic foundation. Age is a modern, simple file encryption tool designed to replace GPG for everyday use.

Age provides strong cryptography with a simple design. It's battle-tested, actively maintained, and designed for exactly this use case - encrypting files with public key cryptography.

### Key Properties

- **Asymmetric encryption** - Each person has a public/private key pair
- **Multiple recipients** - Files can be encrypted for multiple people simultaneously  
- **Strong security** - Uses modern cryptographic primitives (X25519, ChaCha20Poly1305)
- **Simple format** - No configuration complexity or trust networks

## Recipients

Recipients are named individuals who can decrypt specific files. Each recipient has a name, public key (for encryption), and private key (kept secret for decryption).

<TabItem label="Age Keys">

Age keys are purpose-built for encryption:

```bash
# Public key format
age1abc123def456...

# Private key format  
AGE-SECRET-KEY-1ABC123DEF456...
```

Age keys are the recommended choice for new setups.

<TabItem label="SSH Keys">

Existing SSH keys work seamlessly:

```bash
# SSH public key
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5...

# SSH private key (in ~/.ssh/)
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
```

Perfect for teams already using SSH infrastructure.

<Aside type="note">
kiln supports both age keys (purpose-built for encryption) and SSH keys (existing infrastructure). For detailed key format specifications, see [File Formats](/reference/formats/).

## Groups

Groups are collections of recipients that simplify access management. Instead of listing individual users for each file, you can grant access to entire groups.

```toml
[groups]
developers = ["alice", "bob", "charlie"]
admins = ["alice", "david"]
contractors = ["emma", "frank"]
```

**Benefits of groups:**

- Easier management - Add someone to a group instead of every file
- Clear roles - Define organizational roles explicitly
- Flexible access - People can belong to multiple groups
- Future-proof - New group members automatically get appropriate access

## Files and Access Control

kiln organizes secrets into separate files, each with its own access control. This enables environment separation and role-based permissions.

### File Structure

**Default file** - `.kiln.env` - Usually accessible to all team members for shared development secrets.

**Environment files** - `staging.env`, `prod.env` - Environment-specific secrets with restricted access.

**Special purpose** - `shared.env`, `client.env` - Custom files for specific use cases or teams.

### Access Control Patterns

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Universal Access">

Grant access to all recipients:

```toml
[files]
default = { filename = ".kiln.env", access = ["*"] }
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Group-Based">

Grant access by group membership:

```toml
[files]
staging = { filename = "staging.env", access = ["developers"] }
production = { filename = "prod.env", access = ["admins"] }
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Mixed Access">

Combine individuals and groups:

```toml
[files]
special = { 
  filename = "special.env", 
  access = ["alice", "contractors", "emergency-user"] 
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Configuration File

The `kiln.toml` file defines your project's security model. It specifies who can access what (recipients and groups), which files exist and their access rules, and how your team is organized.

### Example Configuration

```toml
# Named recipients with their public keys
[recipients]
alice = "age1abc123..."          # Team lead (age key)
bob = "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3..."    # Developer (SSH key)
charlie = "age1def456..."        # Developer (age key)
david = "age1ghi789..."          # DevOps admin (age key)

# Logical groups for access management
[groups]
developers = ["alice", "bob", "charlie"]
admins = ["alice", "david"]

# Files with granular access control
[files]
default = { filename = ".kiln.env", access = ["*"] }
staging = { filename = "staging.env", access = ["developers"] }
production = { filename = "prod.env", access = ["admins"] }
```

<Aside type="tip">
The configuration file is safe to commit to version control. It contains no secrets - only public keys and access rules.
</Aside>

## Encryption Model

Understanding how kiln encrypts data helps you make informed security decisions.

### Per-File Encryption

Each file is encrypted independently:

1. **Recipient resolution** - kiln determines who can access the file based on `access` rules
2. **Key collection** - Public keys for all authorized recipients are gathered  
3. **Encryption** - The file is encrypted so any authorized recipient can decrypt it
4. **Storage** - Encrypted data is written to the specified filename

### No Shared Secrets

kiln uses public key cryptography exclusively:

- **No master passwords** - Each person uses their own private key
- **No key sharing** - Private keys never leave individual machines
- **Independent access** - Adding/removing people doesn't affect others
- **Forward security** - Removing someone's access doesn't require re-encrypting for others

### Security Properties

- **Confidentiality** - Only authorized recipients can decrypt files
- **Integrity** - Files cannot be modified without detection
- **Authentication** - Each person uses their own cryptographic identity
- **Non-repudiation** - Actions can be traced to specific individuals
