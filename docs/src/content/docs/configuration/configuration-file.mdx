import { Tabs, TabItem, Aside, Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The `kiln.toml` file defines who can access your secrets and how your team is organized. It contains three main sections that control kiln's security model.

## Basic Structure

```toml
# Who can decrypt files
[recipients]
alice = "age1abc123..."
bob = "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3..."

# Optional team groupings
[groups]
developers = ["alice", "bob"]

# Files and their access controls
[files]
default = { filename = ".kiln.env", access = ["*"] }
```

## Recipients Section

The `[recipients]` section maps names to public keys. This is where you define everyone who can decrypt kiln files.

### Supported Key Types

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Age Keys">

```toml
[recipients]
alice = "age1abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678stu901vwx234yz"
bob = "age1def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678stu901vwx234yz567abc"
```

Age keys are 62-character strings starting with `age1`. They're purpose-built for encryption and recommended for new projects.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="SSH Keys">

```toml
[recipients]
charlie = "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIGJhcOOImxvs..."
david = "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABgQC7..."
```

Standard SSH public keys work seamlessly. Perfect for teams already using SSH infrastructure.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Naming Conventions

Use clear, consistent names:

```toml
[recipients]
alice-smith = "age1abc123..."    # Good: clear and consistent
bob-jones = "age1def456..."      # Good: follows same pattern
deploy-bot = "age1ghi789..."     # Good: describes purpose
```

Avoid spaces, special characters, or unclear abbreviations.

## Groups Section

Groups organize recipients into logical collections, simplifying access management.

```toml
[groups]
developers = ["alice", "bob", "charlie"]
admins = ["alice", "david"] 
contractors = ["emma", "frank"]
```

### Common Patterns

**Role-based groups:**
```toml
[groups]
developers = ["alice", "bob"]
ops-team = ["charlie", "david"]
managers = ["alice", "eve"]
```

**Hierarchical access:**
```toml
[groups]
junior-devs = ["bob", "charlie"]
senior-devs = ["alice", "david"]
team-leads = ["alice"]
```

**Project-based groups:**
```toml
[groups]
project-alpha = ["alice", "bob"]
project-beta = ["charlie", "david"]
platform-team = ["alice", "eve"]
```

Recipients must exist in the `[recipients]` section before being used in groups.

## Files Section

The `[files]` section defines encrypted files and who can access them.

```toml
[files]
name = { filename = "path/to/file.env", access = ["who", "can", "access"] }
```

### Access Patterns

**Universal access** - Everyone can decrypt:
```toml
[files]
shared = { filename = "shared.env", access = ["*"] }
```

**Group access** - All group members can decrypt:
```toml
[files]
staging = { filename = "staging.env", access = ["developers"] }
```

**Individual access** - Specific people only:
```toml
[files]
admin = { filename = "admin.env", access = ["alice"] }
```

**Mixed access** - Combine groups and individuals:
```toml
[files]
special = { filename = "special.env", access = ["alice", "developers", "emergency-user"] }
```

### Environment Separation

Typical setup for different environments:

```toml
[files]
development = { filename = "dev.env", access = ["*"] }
staging = { filename = "staging.env", access = ["developers"] }
production = { filename = "prod.env", access = ["ops-team", "team-leads"] }
```

## Access Control Resolution

kiln resolves access by:

1. Expanding `"*"` to all recipients
2. Replacing group names with their members
3. Collecting all unique public keys
4. Encrypting the file for those keys

<Aside type="caution">
Access is additive - recipients in multiple groups get combined access to files.
</Aside>

## Complete Example

```toml
[recipients]
alice-lead = "age1abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678stu901vwx234yz"
bob-dev = "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIGJhcOOImxvs..."
charlie-ops = "age1def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678stu901vwx234yz567abc"
deploy-bot = "age1ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678stu901vwx234yz567abcdef"

[groups]
developers = ["alice-lead", "bob-dev"]
ops-team = ["alice-lead", "charlie-ops"]
automation = ["deploy-bot"]

[files]
development = { filename = "dev.env", access = ["developers"] }
staging = { filename = "staging.env", access = ["developers"] }
production = { filename = "prod.env", access = ["ops-team"] }
deployment = { filename = "deploy.env", access = ["automation"] }
```

## Validation

kiln validates your configuration on load:

- Recipients must have valid public keys
- Groups can only reference defined recipients  
- Files must have non-empty paths and access lists
- Access lists can only reference defined recipients or groups

## Best Practices

- Start simple with basic recipients and files
- Use meaningful names that reflect actual roles
- Regularly audit group memberships as teams change
- Keep access patterns aligned with business needs
- Document complex configurations with comments
