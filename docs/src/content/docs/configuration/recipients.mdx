Recipients and groups form kiln's access control foundation. Recipients are individuals who can decrypt files, while groups organize recipients for easier management.

## Recipients

Recipients map names to public keys. Each represents someone who can decrypt specific files.

```toml
[recipients]
alice = "age1abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678stu901vwx234yz"
bob = "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIGJhcOOImxvs..."
```

### Adding Recipients

<Steps>

1. They generate their key:
   ```bash
   kiln init key
   cat ~/.kiln/kiln.key.pub
   ```

2. Rekey the file with the new recipient:
   ```bash
   kiln rekey --file staging --add-recipient "new-user=age1def456..."
   ```
</Steps>

kiln will automatically add the recipient to the recipients list, and grant them access to the file.

### Removing Recipients

1. Remove from `kiln.toml`
2. Remove from all groups  
3. Rekey affected files

<Aside type="caution">
Removing someone from configuration doesn't immediately revoke access. You must rekey files to exclude them.
</Aside>

### Naming Conventions

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Recommended">

```toml
[recipients]
alice-smith = "age1abc123..."
bob-backend = "age1def456..."  
deploy-bot = "age1ghi789..."
```

Clear names indicating person and role.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Avoid">

```toml
[recipients]
a = "age1abc123..."           # Too short
user123 = "age1def456..."     # Unclear
"Bob Jones" = "age1ghi789..." # Requires quotes
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Groups

Groups organize recipients into logical collections, simplifying access management.

```toml
[groups]
developers = ["alice", "bob", "charlie"]
ops-team = ["alice", "david"]
managers = ["alice", "eve"]
```

### Common Patterns

**Role-based:**
```toml
[groups]
junior-devs = ["bob", "charlie"]
senior-devs = ["alice", "david"]
team-leads = ["alice"]
```

**Project-based:**
```toml
[groups]
project-alpha = ["alice", "bob"]
project-beta = ["charlie", "david"]
platform-team = ["alice", "eve"]
```

### Group Rules

- Recipients must exist before being used in groups
- People can belong to multiple groups
- Groups are resolved during access control, not nested

## Team Scaling

### Small Team (2-5 People)

```toml
[recipients]
alice = "age1abc123..."
bob = "age1def456..."

[groups]
developers = ["alice", "bob"]
admins = ["alice"]
```

### Medium Team (5-20 People)

```toml
[recipients]
alice-lead = "age1abc123..."
bob-senior = "age1def456..."
charlie-mid = "age1ghi789..."
david-ops = "age1jkl012..."

[groups]
developers = ["alice-lead", "bob-senior", "charlie-mid"]
ops-team = ["alice-lead", "david-ops"]
senior-staff = ["alice-lead", "bob-senior"]
```

### Large Team (20+ People)

```toml
[groups]
backend-team = ["alice", "bob", "charlie"]
frontend-team = ["diana", "eve", "frank"]
platform-team = ["george", "henry"]

senior-engineers = ["alice", "diana", "george"]
ops-team = ["george", "henry", "iris"]
```

## Access Resolution

When resolving file access:

1. `"*"` expands to all recipients
2. Group names expand to their members
3. Individual names resolve to public keys
4. Duplicates are removed
5. File is encrypted for all resolved keys

Example:
```toml
[groups]
developers = ["alice", "bob"]

[files]
special = { 
  access = ["alice", "developers", "charlie"] 
}
```

Results in access for: alice, bob, charlie (alice not duplicated).

## Best Practices

- **Start with roles** - Design groups around job functions
- **Use descriptive names** - Names should clearly convey purpose
- **Regular maintenance** - Audit memberships as people change roles
- **Keep groups focused** - Each group should have a single purpose
- **Plan for growth** - Design structures that scale with your team

This foundation enables secure, scalable access control that grows with your team while maintaining clarity about permissions.
