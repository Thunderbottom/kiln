kiln provides a set of focused commands for managing encrypted environment variables with role-based access control. Each command is designed to be secure by default and composable with standard Unix tools.

## Command Structure

All kiln commands follow a consistent pattern:

```bash
kiln [global-options] <command> [command-options] [arguments]
```

### Global Options

- `--config`, `-c`: Configuration file path (default: `kiln.toml`)
- `--key`, `-k`: Private key file path (auto-discovered if not specified)
- `--verbose`, `-v`: Enable verbose output for debugging
- `--help`, `-h`: Show help information
- `--version`: Show version information

### File Selection

Most commands accept a `--file` or `-f` option to specify which environment file to operate on. This corresponds to entries in your `kiln.toml` configuration.

## Command Categories

### Initialization Commands
- [`init key`](/commands/init/#init-key) - Generate encryption keys
- [`init config`](/commands/init/#init-config) - Create configuration files

### Variable Management
- [`set`](/commands/set) - Add, update, or bulk import environment variables
- [`get`](/commands/get) - Retrieve specific variables
- [`edit`](/commands/edit) - Interactive editing of environment files

### Output and Integration
- [`export`](/commands/export) - Output variables in various formats
- [`run`](/commands/run) - Execute commands with injected environment

### Administration
- [`rekey`](/commands/rekey) - Add recipients and rotate encryption
- [`info`](/commands/info) - Display file status and verification

All commands use encrypted storage with role-based access control.

## Error Handling

kiln commands use semantic exit codes:

- `0`: Success
- `1`: General error (validation, configuration, access denied)
- `2`: Command execution error (for `run` command)

Error messages are designed to be actionable and include suggestions for resolution.
