title: Configuration Schema
description: Complete TOML configuration reference for kiln projects with validation rules and examples.
---

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The `kiln.toml` configuration file defines recipients, access control, and file mappings for your project. All configuration options are validated at load time with clear error messages.

## Schema Overview

```toml
[recipients]
name = "public-key"

[groups]
group-name = ["recipient1", "recipient2"]

[files]
[files.env-name]
filename = "path/to/file.env"
access = ["recipient-or-group"]
```

## Recipients Section

<Aside type="note">
Recipients define named public keys that can decrypt environment files. Both age and SSH public keys are supported.
</Aside>

### Syntax

```toml
[recipients]
alice = "age1234567890abcdef..."
bob = "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5..."
```

### Validation Rules

- **Name requirements**: Must be valid identifier (letters, numbers, underscore, hyphen)
- **Key format**: Must be valid age public key (`age1...`) or SSH public key (`ssh-...`)
- **Uniqueness**: Each recipient name must be unique within the configuration
- **Key validation**: Public keys are validated for correct format and encoding

### Supported Key Types

**Age Public Keys:**
```toml
admin = "age1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef"
```

**SSH Ed25519 Keys:**
```toml
developer = "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIGbM7ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ user@host"
```

**SSH RSA Keys:**
```toml
legacy = "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC... user@host"
```

## Groups Section

<Aside type="tip">
Groups simplify access management by allowing you to grant permissions to multiple recipients at once.
</Aside>

### Syntax

```toml
[groups]
developers = ["alice", "bob", "charlie"]
admins = ["alice", "admin"]
contractors = ["external-dev"]
```

### Validation Rules

- **Group names**: Must be valid identifiers, cannot conflict with recipient names
- **Member validation**: All group members must exist in the `[recipients]` section
- **Circular references**: Groups cannot reference other groups (flat structure only)
- **Empty groups**: Groups must contain at least one member

### Access Patterns

**Role-based access:**
```toml
[groups]
frontend = ["alice", "bob"]
backend = ["charlie", "dave"]
devops = ["admin", "deploy"]
```

**Environment-based access:**
```toml
[groups]
dev-team = ["alice", "bob", "charlie"]
prod-team = ["admin", "senior-dev"]
```

## Files Section

<Aside type="caution">
File configurations define which encrypted files exist and who can access them. Access control is enforced at the file level.
</Aside>

### Syntax

```toml
[files.env-name]
filename = "path/to/encrypted/file"
access = ["recipient-or-group-or-wildcard"]
```

### Required Fields

**`filename`**: Path to the encrypted environment file
- Relative to configuration file location
- Can use subdirectories: `"environments/prod.env"`
- Must be unique across all file definitions

**`access`**: Array of recipients, groups, or wildcards
- Individual recipients: `["alice", "bob"]`
- Groups: `["developers", "admins"]`
- Mixed: `["alice", "developers"]`
- Wildcard: `["*"]` (grants access to all recipients)

### Validation Rules

- **File paths**: Must be valid file paths, cannot contain `..` for security
- **Access validation**: All access entries must reference valid recipients or groups
- **Non-empty access**: Access array cannot be empty
- **Unique filenames**: Each filename can only be used once

### Common Patterns

**Environment separation:**
```toml
[files.development]
filename = "dev.env"
access = ["*"]

[files.staging]
filename = "staging.env"
access = ["developers", "qa"]

[files.production]
filename = "prod.env"
access = ["admins"]
```

**Service-specific files:**
```toml
[files.database]
filename = "db.env"
access = ["backend", "devops"]

[files.api-keys]
filename = "keys.env"
access = ["admins"]
```

## Configuration Validation

### Load-time Validation

Kiln validates configuration when loading:

1. **TOML syntax**: Must be valid TOML format
2. **Schema compliance**: All sections and fields must follow the schema
3. **Reference integrity**: Groups and access lists must reference valid recipients
4. **Key format validation**: All public keys must be properly formatted
5. **Path security**: File paths must be safe (no directory traversal)

### Error Messages

**Invalid recipient reference:**
```
Error: configuration error: group 'developers' references unknown recipient 'unknown-user'
```

**Invalid public key:**
```
Error: configuration error: recipient 'alice' has invalid public key format
```

**Duplicate filename:**
```
Error: configuration error: filename 'app.env' is used by multiple file definitions
```

## Environment Variables

### Configuration Override

- `KILN_CONFIG_FILE`: Override default configuration file path
- `KILN_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE`: Override default private key discovery

### Runtime Behavior

- Configuration is loaded and validated once per command execution
- Changes require command restart to take effect
- Invalid configuration prevents all operations

## Best Practices

### Maintainability

1. **Descriptive names**: Use clear recipient and group names
2. **Logical grouping**: Organize recipients by role or responsibility
3. **Documentation**: Comment complex access patterns
4. **Version control**: Track configuration changes in version control

### Example Complete Configuration

```toml
# Team members with their public keys
[recipients]
alice-admin = "age1234567890abcdef..."
bob-dev = "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5..."
charlie-dev = "age0987654321fedcba..."
deploy-bot = "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQAB..."

# Access groups for role-based permissions
[groups]
developers = ["bob-dev", "charlie-dev"]
admins = ["alice-admin"]
automation = ["deploy-bot"]

# Environment files with granular access control
[files.development]
filename = "environments/dev.env"
access = ["*"]  # All team members

[files.staging]
filename = "environments/staging.env"
access = ["developers", "admins"]

[files.production]
filename = "environments/prod.env"
access = ["admins", "automation"]

[files.secrets]
filename = "secrets/api-keys.env"
access = ["admins"]
```

## Migration Guide

### From Legacy Configurations

If migrating from older configuration formats:

1. **Validate syntax**: Ensure TOML format compliance
2. **Update key formats**: Convert any legacy key formats
3. **Review access patterns**: Audit and update access controls
4. **Test thoroughly**: Verify all team members can access appropriate files

### Schema Evolution

Future schema changes will maintain backward compatibility where possible. Breaking changes will include migration guidance and tooling.
